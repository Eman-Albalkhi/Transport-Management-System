# Transport-Management-System
project is a Transport Management System, which aims to classify registered transportation vehicles within a suitable software structure. The project includes several components, including a "Transport Object" that contains information such as the vehicle number, manufacturer, manufacturing date, speed, ownership type, and vehicle type.

The project also includes interfaces to retrieve the name of the transportation vehicle and issue alerts if the gross weight of an aircraft or truck exceeds the allowed maximum, or if the actual weight of the cargo exceeds the maximum weight for passenger aircraft.

Transportation vehicles are classified into aerial and wilderness transport. Aerial transport includes passenger aircraft and cargo planes, while wilderness transport includes buses, cars, and trucks.

The project also features characteristics specific to aerial and wilderness transport. Aerial transport properties include the number of engines and length, while wilderness transport properties include engine capacity and length.

Additionally, the project includes a component for journeys, which contains information such as the journey number, vehicle number, type of transport (cargo/passenger), journey date, departure and arrival details, reservation records (a dynamic array indicating the status of each booked seat), baggage weight, cargo weight, gross weight, and weight increase alerts.

This project can be used to facilitate the management of transportation vehicles and improve their efficiency. It is characterized by a suitable software structure
